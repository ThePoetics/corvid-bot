(sender) is away, lurking in the depths of literature and planning their next adventure
(sender) is off on a quest for inspiration
(sender) is seeking inspiration elsewhere for the time being
Don't bother (sender), they're in deep thought about what to create next
(sender) sneaks off to read another chapter of a great book
The clickety-clack from (sender)'s keyboard shows they're busy creating new worlds
(sender) is taking a break from taking a break
There once was a (sender) from Nantucket ... no, no, that doesn't rhyme
It's time for (sender) to put their head down and dream of new possibilities for a while
(sender) is off to sharpen their wits for the coming battles
Has anyone seen (sender)? Their stuff is still here so they must be coming back
(sender) is drowning out the world by diving into imagination
As the Bard once penned, "Exit (sender), pursued by bear"
