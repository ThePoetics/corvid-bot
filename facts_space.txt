The colors shown in images of the Cosmic Microwave Background differ in temperature by less than a millionth of a degree
Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons, is so icy that it reflects 90% of the sun's light
A sideral day is roughly 23.5 hours long, due to the orbit of the Earth around the Sun

Uranus is tilted more than 90 degrees, likely due to a massive impact in the distant past
Neptune's moon Triton is the only known moon that orbits in retrograde
Light from the Sun takes 8 minutes to reach Earth, but thousands of years for that energy to escape from the Sun in the first place
Due to international treaties, the boundry for 'outer space' is 62 miles (100km) above sea-level

Gamma-ray bursts can release more energy in a second than our Sun will in its entire lifetime
The "solar wind" is a stream of charged particles blasting out from the Sun
Light from distant stars and galaxies has been redshifted, meaning stretched out, due to the expansion of space
